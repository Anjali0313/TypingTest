      title: "The Hare and the Tortoise",
      content: "Once, there was a hare who was best friends with a tortoise. The hare was very proud of how fast he could run, so one day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. The tortoise agreed, even though everyone thought he was way too slow to win. The race began, and the hare raced so fast that he was far ahead of the tortoise. Feeling confident, the hare decided to take a nap under a tree while the tortoise kept going, step by step. When the hare woke up, he was shocked to see the tortoise crossing the finish line. The tortoise had won the race!",

      content: "One day, a dog found a big, tasty bone. He was so excited that he grabbed it and ran to find a quiet spot to chew it in peace. While crossing a river, he looked down and saw his reflection in the water. But the silly dog thought it was another dog with another bone! Greedy for more, the dog barked to snatch that “other” bone. But as soon as he opened his mouth, his own bone dropped into the water and sank. The poor dog lost it all and had to go home with nothing.",

Slowly, the water rose higher and higher until it was close enough for him to drink. The crow finally quenched his thirst and flew away happily.",
